Ultracold molecules enable exploration of many-body physics due to their highly tunable dipolar interactions. Here, I will review our recent observations of out-of-equilibrium spin dynamics with polar molecules. With spin encoded in the lowest rotational states of the molecules, we realized a generalized t-J model with dipolar interactions [1]. We explored the role of Ising and spin-exchange couplings tuned with dc electric fields and the eLect of motion regulated by optical lattices on Ramsey contrast decay. Theoretical understanding of the experimental measurements will also be discussed. Further, we realized XXZ spin models with Floquet engineering [2] and verified that they produced similar dynamics as those controlled by dc electric fields. We additionally used Floquet engineering to realize a two-axis twisting Hamiltonian, inaccessible with static fields, and studied its mean-field dynamics. This work sets the stage for future explorations of exotic spin Hamiltonians with the tunability of molecular platforms.
