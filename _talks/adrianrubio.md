Brownian motion and parametric resonance are two paradigmatic phenomena particularly
taking place on harmonic dynamical systems, covering a plethora of branches in science.
While the former gives a pathway to include dissipation and noise (additive noise) in a
system, the latter stands for a physical mechanism that supplies energy to a system by
exploiting the resonant variation of the characteristic frequency. Both aspects find their
syncretism in the so-called stochastic resonance, where the competition between dissipation
and the strength of the fluctuations in the characteristic frequency of the system
(multiplicative noise) defines whether the system undergoes exponential growth (as in
parametric resonance) or stabilises in a steady state in the long-time limit[1]. Typically, the
impact of this competition is neglected due to relatively high dissipation rates that
overcome resonant effects. However, the development of harmonic systems with
increasingly quality factors makes this competition to come into play, raising as a potential
limiting factor but also as a possibility for a novel control mechanism. In this talk, I will
introduce the basics of the mentioned dynamical phenomena to quantify its impact on
experimental setups, such as optically levitated nanoparticle. Moreover, I will also show
how these concepts enter interacting harmonic systems, giving place to enhanced resonant
behaviours in the steady state. The latter can be exploited, for instance, for heat transport
and thermalisation[2].
