The progress in realising ultracold atomic mixtures has greatly revitalised the interest in
studying impurities immersed in quantum mediums [1]. Amongst them, Bose polarons, i.e.
impurities immersed in bosonic baths, have attracted increased attention since their
experimental realisation in 2016 [2, 3]. Following these developments, and motivated by
the possibility of trapping ultracold atoms in optical lattices [4], the theoretical study of
impurities in lattice configurations has emerged as a new platform for studying polaron
physics. In this direction, in the past few years, different studies of lattice Bose polarons
have revealed intriguing features across the superfluid-to-Mott insulator transition [5-7].

In this work, we study an impurity interacting with a bosonic bath and immersed in a
harmonically confined optical lattice. The harmonic confinement enables us to model a
realistic scenario and study polaron physics across superfluid and Mott domains. We
consider a one-dimensional configuration and study the system theoretically with DMRG
simulations for a large number of particles. We reveal that baths with Mott domains
produce an enlargement of the polaron cloud and the onset of a sudden orthogonality
catastrophe of the polaron quasiparticle.
