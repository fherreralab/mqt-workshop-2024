The use of Stochastic Schr√∂dinger Equations (SSE) to describe open quantum systems
is a well-known class of methods, that can be used as an unravelling scheme of
associated Quantum Master Equations and as a starting point to derive new ones. From
the perspective of simulating quantum systems in Quantum Computers (QC), one can
exploit stochastic averages to implement intrinsically contractive mappings into
unitary-gates bases QC since each trajectory is a unitary evolution of the system [1,2]
and harnesses the repeated noisy measures in lieu of classical parallelization. Recent
studies have shown the ability to engineer environmental effects, in particular
concerning non-Markovian environments [3,4]. Such noises can be detrimental to or
enhance the coherence time and the transport properties of the system. Here, we
present a theoretical description of the differences between using a stochastic process
and its derived noise as sources of fluctuations in the stochastic formulation of the
dynamics of an open quantum system, and their associated QME.

The starting point is the model presented in [6], leading to non-Markovian quantum
evolution in small model systems. Showing the different interpretations, we remark the
differences with respect to the usual memoryless approximations and the effects on
initial coherence time and stationary distributions.
