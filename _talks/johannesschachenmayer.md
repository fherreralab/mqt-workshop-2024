Theoretically explaining collective cavity-modified physics and chemistry remains to be a challenge for a large number N of coupled molecules. Key mechanism responsible for experimental observations are still lacking a theoretical understanding up to date. In particular, the question about how local chemistry can be modified in a macroscopic limit (with vanishing single-emitter coupling strengths) is important and still open.
This talk will first review how we suggested that disorder and semi-localized [1] dark states can lead to a robust modification of nuclear dynamics, also in the large-N limit in a toy-model molecule setup [2]. Answering the question also for realistic molecules will require more advanced numerical methodologies for large-scale quantum many-body dynamics with long- range connectivity and couplings to an environment. This talk focuses on our recent advances with semi-classical phase space methods [3,4] and with new open-sysem matrix product state approaches [5], and explains how they could become important for the young research field of polaritonic chemistry.
