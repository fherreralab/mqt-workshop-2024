Quantum computers can solve a wide range of computational problems, including
molecular optimization and simulations. An effective approach to harnessing the
capabilities of quantum computing is the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), an
algorithm that combines quantum and classical resources to determine the minimum
energy of molecules. In this work, we apply the VQE algorithm to explore molecular
electronic structures, focusing on the simulation of molecular configurations and
isomerization reactions by using currently available quantum computers.
