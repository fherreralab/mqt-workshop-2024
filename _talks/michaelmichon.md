Reports of altered chemical phenomena under vibrational strong coupling (VSC), including
reaction rates, product distributions, intermolecular forces, and cavity-mediated vibrational
energy transfer, have been met with a great deal of skepticism due to several irreproducible
results and the lack of an accepted theoretical framework. In this work, we add some
insight by identifying a UV-vis measurement artifact that distorts observed absorption peak
positions, amplitudes, and consequently, chemical reaction rates extracted in optical
microcavities. We predict and characterize the behavior of this artifact using the Transfer
Matrix (TM) method and confirm its presence experimentally. We then present a correction
technique whereby an effective molar absorption coefficient is assigned to an absorbing
species within the cavity. These revelations have important implications for many existing
examples of cavity-modified chemistry and establishing best practices for carrying out
robust future investigations.
