Scaling up quantum processors remains very challenging, even for today’s most successful platforms. Molecular complexes, able to encode d-dimensional qudits in their electronic and nuclear spin states, can act as universal quantum processors or even correct errors [1]. I’ll discuss recent experiments aimed at exploiting these systems by coupling them to superconducting resonators [2,3]. A high cooperativity coupling to electronic and even nuclear spins has been achieved [3,4]. We also find that it is possible to couple excitations of remote, and distinct, spin ensembles by means of interactions mediated by the circuit. The results provide the basis for the control, readout and communication of spin qubits and qudits and for implementations of quantum
algorithms.
