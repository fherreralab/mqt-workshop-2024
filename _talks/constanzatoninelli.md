In this contribution, the generation of quantum states of light from single molecules is discussed, tailored to multiple and diverse applications. We will focus on the use of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), embedded in host matrices [1]. These molecules, due to their small size and well-defined properties, serve as nanoscopic sensors for pressure, strain, temperature, and various fields. The talk discusses recent advancements in coupling single PAH molecules to photonic structures to enhance and control their interaction with light [2]. Notably, two-photon interference experiments between photons emitted by diLerent molecules on the same chip are presented, addressing a fundamental challenge in solid-state platforms for photonic quantum technologies [3]. The experiment relies on multiple milestones, including addressing several molecules simultaneously as on-demand single-photon sources [4], independently tuning their frequencies optically [5,6], and conducting real-time measurements of two-photon interference [3,7]. Additionally, the presentation explores the use of organic molecules as nanoscopic thermal sensors, enabling semi- invasive local temperature measurements in a temperature range (3 K to 30 K) unattainable by most commercial technologies [8]. These results oLer insights into the local phononic environment in complex structures and an unexplored temperature regime. Finally, we will comment on the new prospects of using single molecules as interfaces between spin, optical and mechanical degrees of freedom.
