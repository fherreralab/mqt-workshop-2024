The recent isolation of two-dimensional (2D) magnets oLers tantalizing opportunities for spintronics, magnonics and quantum technologies at the limit of miniaturization.[1] Among the key advantages of atomically-thin materials are their flexibility, which provides an exciting avenue to control their properties by strain engineering, and the more eLicient tuning of their properties with respect to their bulk counterparts. In this presentation we will provide an overview of our recent results on this fascinating topic. First, we will focus on the magnetic properties, magnon dispersion and spin dynamics of the air-stable 2D magnetic semiconductor CrSBr (TC = 146 K)[2] and will investigate their evolution under mechanical strain and Coulomb screening using first- principles.[3] Then, we will introduce the modulation of the magnetic properties, magnon dispersion and spin dynamics of this 2D magnet after the deposition of sublimable organic molecules[4]. Our results predict a modulation of magnetic exchange, a shift in the magnon frequencies and an enhancement of their group velocities up to ∼7%. Interestingly, we find a linear correlation between these eLects and the donor character of the molecules. This will pave the way for the design of a new class of magnonic materials that can be selectively tailored by a chemical approach.
