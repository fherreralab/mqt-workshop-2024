New materials capable of eLiciently generating entangled photons can lead to improved eLciciency, increased scalability, enhanced signal stability, broadened operational conditions, and lower costs. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are crystalline, nanoporous materials self- assembled from inorganic nodes and organic linkers. The building blocks of these materials oLer an ideal materials platform to design and explore fundamental aspects of materials that govern entangled photon generation. In this presentation, I will discuss our eLorts to establish a multiscale methodology that leverages quantum chemical calculations for predicting entangled photon generation in MOFs.1 Then, I will discuss our eLorts to determine structure-property relationships linking chemical and material properties to those of the entangled photons.2,3 Lastly, I will discuss chemical functionalization strategies and their eLects on the optical properties of MOFs.
