Diamond-based quantum sensing, through the use of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers
embedded in diamond crystals, has revolutionized the study of cellular biology by
providing unprecedented capabilities in free radical sensing [1,2]. This groundbreaking
technique, known as relaxometry, leverages the unique properties of NV centers to translate
magnetic noise into optical signals, achieving remarkable sensitivity and nanoscale spatial
resolution.

The ability of relaxometry to detect free radical production within living cells is pivotal for
understanding various biological processes. For example, this technology has illuminated
the role of free radicals in sperm development [3] and provided real-time, subcellular
monitoring of their involvement in cancer cell migration [4], offering critical insights into
metastatic mechanisms.

Moreover, diamond-based quantum sensing paves the way for exploring complex
biological samples, including tissues and entire organisms, with NV centers. Despite the
potential, challenges such as particle control, reproducibility, and biocompatibility must be
overcome to fully harness this technology.

In summary, diamond-based quantum sensing represents a transformative advancement in
the detection and characterization of free radicals within living cells, offering profound
implications for our comprehension of cellular dynamics, disease progression, and the
essential roles of free radicals in biological systems.
