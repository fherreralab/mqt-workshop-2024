Nonlinear optical microscopy and spectroscopy are powerful tools to characterize
interfaces and lower-dimensional materials. Here, I show two examples how we use
infrared + visible sum-frequency generation to image mid-infrared materials
excitations with wide-field optical microscopy. The techniques provide combined
spatial and spectral information. 1. We visualize the propagation patterns of infrared
phonon polaritons in a metasurface of silicon carbide (Fig. 1a-c) [1]. Through a
combination of microscopy and spectroscopy, we observe the hybridization and strong
coupling of propagating and localized polaritons. 2. We visualize monolayers of
hexagonal boron nitride on an insulating substrate (Fig. 1d). This material is usually
optically invisible because of its large band gap. Resonant infrared excitation of
phonons and heterodyne sum-frequency imaging enable us to image, both, its
topography and crystal orientation.
