Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are not just crystalline materials; they hold immense
potential for optical sensing applications [1]. Their unique characteristics, such as porosity,
tuneability, and specificity, make them a perfect fit for this field. When coupled with
optical fiber (OF), the sensor becomes portable, reusable, and non-destructive. While some
single-crystal MOFs coupled with fiber optics systems have shown promising results, the
materials used are still limited to a few well-studied examples [2, 3]. Sensitivity to different
molecules and the performance of distinct system OF-MOFs upon loading are necessary to
develop new sensor devices. The chemical space formed by MOFs is complex and large,
but computational methods can efficiently explore and characterize the optical properties,
providing an avenue for further design. In this work, we search for suitable MOF
candidates for chemical sensors using chemoinformatics methods based on text pattern
search of chemical names, compute adsorption isotherms with Monte-Carlo simulation to
predict sensitivity limits for adsorbate concentration and the corresponding refractive index
change is obtained using periodic density functional theory. We aim to establish the basis
for a computational filter and characterization of MOFs for optical sensing of gases in
interferometric setups that can be further used in quantum sensing protocols with
nonclassical light.
