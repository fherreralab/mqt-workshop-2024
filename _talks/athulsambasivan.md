Near field plasmonic resonances that happen in metallic nanostructures provide a fascinating
way to engineer the interaction between light and matter [1]. It has been demonstrated that
the coupling between the cavity field and matter can lead to strong coupling with a single
emitter in plasmonic cavities [2]. We study the strongly coupled dynamical processes of a
dipole emitter coupled to near-field modes of a plasmonic nanosphere using macroscopic
quantum electrodynamics (QED) and explore the possibility of manipulating the photonic
local density of states by driving the system with narrowband laser sources. To achieve this,
we develop a pseudo-mode representation of the electromagnetic dyadic Green’s tensor of a
nanosphere with dipolar and higher-order plasmonic resonant modes, to build semi-analytical
solutions of the set of coupled non-Markovian integro-differential equations (IDE) that
describe the laser-driven dynamics of material dipoles and photonic degrees of freedom. We
solve for experimentally relevant photonic and dipolar observables for a single dipole emitter
in a resonant optical nanocavity and compare the results with recent phenomenological
Markovian models developed for molecular polaritons [3].
